		          My name is Kevin Shao, a 2nd-year master student studying in Electrical and
		          Computer Engineering. I completed my bachelor degree with Magna Cum Laude
		          in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State Univeristy. I was
		          a member of OSU Humanitarian Engineering Scholar Program. In my free time,
		          I love to travel to see unqiue culture and history from different countries.
		          Sketching and painting are also some great ways to make me relaxed. I worked
		          on a number of research projects in applications to machine learning (i.e.
		          object detection and tracking). I am very interested in interdisciplinary
		          research to develope innovative technologies or systems, especially human-computer
		          interaction in healthcare and education.
