			<ul>
				<li>Created a solution that can provide a reliable and accurate assessment of whether or not chargers are working, to generate a more positive charging experience for electric vehicle (EV) owners.</li>
			  <li>Developed a cloud computing system that can analyze the raw data received from the vehicle’s state of charge (SoC), determine the health of an EV charger and estimate charging time using machine learning models, and send statistics back to the iOS app.</li>
        <li>Designed a user-friendly app with SwiftUI framework that can display cloud-based data about chargers’ health with live charging updates and integrate a mapping feature that provides quick routing options via Apple Maps.</li>
			  <li>Verified and validated the design by interviewing 5 users that answered the same questionnaire using multiple 1-5 scale questions for design evaluation.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Designed, constructed, and operated a narrowband sparse sensor array to estimate direction of arrival (DoA).</li>
        <li>Utilized MATLAB programs and MLE estimator to determine DoAs from relative phases of each sensor in the linear and planar sparse array geometries.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated the array placement strategy and DoA estimation techniques presented in Ohio State University (OSU) invention disclosure T2022-060.</li>

			<h3>Design Challenge</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Instead of plasterboard, which can melt or mold when exposed to water, the design is made of EPS foam, and structural laminates are used for the walls, floors, and roof, making the Casita house stronger and more durable than ordinary buildings</li>
			  <li>Sought out the lowest cost prefabricated materials and broke new ground in the structural and technical areas</li>
        <li>Conducted the building process as a Humanitarian Engineering Scholar to help people in need</li>
      </ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>Advanced Energy Vehicle</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Presented a preliminary case study based on a Model Predictive Control-based strategy that uses a prediction of the future driving pattern and load request in order to minimize fuel use by generating only at the most efficient moments</li>
				<li>Developed Advanced Energy Vehicles (AEVs) and verified the performance of AEVs by structural Analysis Simulation and CFD Flow Simulation, which provided a reference for AEVs structure analysis and optimization</li>

			<h3>Software Design Project</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Combined problem-solving strategies, design process, and programming skills in a team setting to propose an applied Smart AI technology exercise for both Hangman and Connect Four in Matlab</li>
				<li>Realized the visualization function based on programming and modeling</li>
				<li>Revised with trial and error by execution result by implementing of hand method of both games</li>
