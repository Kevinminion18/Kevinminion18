        <img src="img/project_thumb.png" alt="Logo" class="logo">
        <p>
          Many dog owners struggle to effectively respond to and manage their dogs' emotional and
          reactive behaviors, particularly in high-stress or unexpected situations such as barking
          at other dog or behaving abnormally in unfamiliar environments. This issue stems from a
          lack of tools to help owners interpret and address their dogs’ behaviors in real-time,
          compounded by limited opportunities to learn from these situations to prevent recurrence.
          This creates challenges in both immediate intervention and long-term behavior management,
          leaving owners feeling unprepared and dogs more anxious.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="title">How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>
        Our approach emphasizes equipping dog owners with the means to respond to immediate behavioral
        challenges with Augmented reality (AR) and reflect on those scenarios for deeper understanding
        with Virtual reality (VR). By focusing on both the reactive and proactive aspects of behavior
        management, the design ensures that owners are not only able to address a situation as it arises
        but also gain insights into potential triggers and alternatives for future prevention. This dual
        focus helps build owners’ confidence in navigating complex behavioral challenges while fostering
        a stronger connection with their pets.
      </p>

      <h3 class="title">Key Functionalities</h3>
      <p>
        Our two key functionalities—supporting in-the-moment crisis response and practicing skills to
        interpret emotional cues—align perfectly with DawgSense's dual AR and VR capabilities. The AR
        mode on Orion glasses enables real-time detection of behavioral cues and crisis triggers during
        live interactions with the dog, guiding the user to de-escalate or manage situations effectively
        as they happen. The VR practice mode enables the reflective learning by allowing users to replay
        past crises and revisit previously encountered scenarios, learning to identify and interpret signs
        of anxiety, stress, or aggression in a safe environment. The synergy between our focused tasks and
        design stems from how AR and VR complement each other, creating a well-rounded system that not only
        enhances immediate responses but also builds dog owners' foundational knowledge and confidence in
        understanding and managing dog behavior in various real-world contexts.

            function (AR mode), a pop-up notification “Analyzing in Real-Time” and a visual clue of the dog’s
            tail movement status appear. This assures the user that the system is actively scanning their dog’s
            behaviors and environmental triggers.

      <h3 class="title">Design Research and Key Insights</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of our design research was to understand the challenges dog owners face in interpreting
        and managing their pets' emotional and reactive behaviors. We aimed to identify gaps in current
        solutions and explore how real-time emotional monitoring could enhance behavior management. Our
        method was to conduct semi-structured interviews with three participants: a dog owner, a veterinarian,
        and a dog trainer, each providing unique perspectives on dog behavior, training, and management.
        These participants were selected for their diverse experiences, ensuring a holistic view of the
        challenges faced. Semi-structured interviews were chosen to allow flexibility in gathering in-depth
        insights into dog's emotional cues, behavioral management, and training needs. This approach provided
        actionable insights that informed our design decisions.

          “It’s hard to know what’s going on in her mind until it’s too late, and by then, she’s already reacting.”
          <br><br>
          The quote from the dog trainer revealed that dog owners struggle to recognize early signs of stress or anxiety
          in their pets, often leading to delayed responses that exacerbate reactive behaviors. This highlighted the
          importance of real-time tools for detecting subtle cues. Incorporating this into our design, we prioritized
          features like AR-driven real-time behavior analysis to guide owners in preventing crises before they escalate.

      <h3 class="subtitle">Owner Education Requires Long-Term, Reflective Approaches</h3>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <p>
          “Dog owners need to learn how to manage their own emotions since stress can transfer to pets.”
          <br><br>
          The quote from the veterinarian highlighted the need for comprehensive education on dog behavior. This
          insight shaped our focus on combining immediate support with long-term learning tools, such as VR scenarios
          for reflective practice, helping owners understand their dog's triggers and manage interactions proactively.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="title">Iterative Design and Key Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Our iterative design process started with low-fidelity sketches to establish basic design concepts based on our
        design research. We evolved these sketches into storyboards and task walkthroughs to convey context and illustrate
        interactions, focusing on two primary tasks: supporting in-the-moment crisis responses and practicing behavioral
        interpretation. This led to the development of paper prototypes and heuristic evaluations, where we identified
        crucial usability issues such as the absence of a back/undo button and confusing visual indicators. Usability testing
        with target users further revealed problems like insufficient feedback, complex task flows, and unclear navigation,
        which informed our refinement in the digital mockup stage. <br><br>
        Reflecting on this process, the iterative nature of our design approach—from prototyping to user testing—was
        instrumental in uncovering and addressing user needs effectively, making the final design both intuitive and
        effective. Each cycle provided critical insights that directly shaped subsequent revisions, culminating in a design
        that helps dog owners manage and understand their pets' behavior both in real time and through reflective learning.
