        The underrepresentation of Students Living with Disabilities (SLWD) in engineering fields
        highlights a critical educational equity gap. This gap necessitates fundamental changes within
        academia to not only addresses accessibility but also embraces the full spectrum of student
        diversity to truly close the equity gap. Current research underscores the effectiveness of
        personalized learning strategies, which consistently lead to improved learning outcomes and
        increased student engagement, diversity, and inclusion. However, our systematic literature
        review reveals a pronounced scarcity of AI-driven learning tools developed specifically for
        post-secondary STEM education. The majority of existing tools are designed primarily for
        K-12 students, overlooking the distinct, more advanced challenges faced by SLWD in higher education.

          Three core pillars of our research: Accessibility, Engineering Education, and Artificial
          ntelligence. By intersecting these areas, we aim to create a more inclusive and engaging
          learning environment for college students living with disabilities in engineering programs,
          and more broadly, across STEM disciplines.. The overlapping region represents the synergy
          where all three pillars converge, driving the development of tailored, AI-driven solutions
          that enhance both educational outcomes and equity for SLWD.

      <h3 class="title">Key Milestones</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Phase 1: Literature Review: Identify existing research gaps, particularly in AI-driven tools
          for post-secondary STEM education for SLWD. This phase focuses on understanding the current
          landscape and pinpointing the areas most lacking in support and technology.
        </li>
        <li>Phase 2: Mixed-Method User Studies
          <ul>
            <li>
              Surveys: Conduct comprehensive surveys to gather data on demographics, learning styles,
              environmental factors, and experiences with existing AI-powered tools among the general
              student body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Semi-structured Interviews: Dive deeper into SLWD’s learning experiences, both traditional
              and technologically enhanced, to grasp the potential and current effectiveness of AI-driven
              tools. This phase also explores DEI aspects within AI education environments.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 3: Data analysis: Analyze the qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews and
          quantitative data from the survey to establish design principles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 4: Prototype Development: Create initial digital mockups of the AI-driven platform
          based on data-driven design principles and develop a functional prototype incorporating
          feedback with inspection-based testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 5: Usability Testing and Iterative Design: Conduct extensive usability testing with
          SLWD to refine and adjust the platform. This iterative process ensures the tool is responsive
          to user needs and accessible in various learning environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 6: Outcome Consolidation: Consolidate outcomes and publish findings.
        </li>
      </ul>
