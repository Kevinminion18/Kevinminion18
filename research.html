			<h3>Direction of arrival estimation with nonuniform sparse arrays (Professor: Lee C Potter)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Experimentally measure the locations of microphones, sampled sound at each location, elevation angles between the signal and microphone</li>
        <li>Implement and demonstrate sparse linear and planar arrays designed with constraints and RMSE performance</li>
        <li>Compute noise power, CRLB theoretical bound on error variance, MLE estimator of DOA, and PRoM estimator of DOA</li>
			  <li>Implement the optimized designs to determine the position that could generate the set of angle without aliasing and demonstrate its performance</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Control and Intelligent Transportations Research Lab (Research scientist: Ekim Yurtsever)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Proposed and developed a small-scale research platform for intelligent transportation systems</li>
			  <li>Solved various dependencies issues and used OpenPCDet to train the Kitti Datasets</li>
			  <li>Propose a more sensitive and accurate approach to count the vehicles with ROSBAG extraction simultaneously, instead of using the existed video files processing method</li>
			  <li>The designed vehicle counting program with yolo algorithm allows to extract bidirectional vehicle counts from a moving observation platform, define the counting area with georeferencing, extract Bird's Eye View (BEV) trajectories of observed vehicles</li>

			<p1>Machine Learning Application Research (Assistant Professor: Pengtao Xie)</p1>
			<ul>
				<li>A DARTS structure-based machine learning method is proposed, which can learn Spatio-temporal data end-to-end using a spatial model, and thus apply it in the simulation of the model of COVID-Net.</li>
        <li>Presented a multi-level optimization framework to formulate LBT which involves three learning stages: teacher learns; teacher teaches student; teacher and student validate themselves.</li>
        <li>An efficient algorithm to solve the LBT problem has been developed and applied the approach to neural architecture search on CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method</li>
